This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using Expo CLI with managed workflow projects. The error arises from a version mismatch between the Expo CLI and the project's configuration.  The `bug.js` file shows a scenario that would trigger the error, while `bugSolution.js` illustrates how to resolve it.  This is a crucial issue for developers working with Expo, as it can halt the build process entirely.  The solution involves ensuring the compatibility of Expo CLI version with the project's Expo SDK version.
