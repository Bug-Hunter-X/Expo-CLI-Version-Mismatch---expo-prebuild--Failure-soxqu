The solution involves updating your Expo CLI to a version compatible with your project's `expo-sdk` version specified in `package.json` or `app.json`/`app.config.js`. You can update your Expo CLI using npm or yarn:
```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
# or
yarn global add expo-cli
```
After updating, run `expo prebuild` again.  If the issue persists, ensure your `app.json` or `app.config.js` file is correctly formatted and adheres to the current Expo specifications. You might also need to check for any conflicting packages in your `package.json`.
